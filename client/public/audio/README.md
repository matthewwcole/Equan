# Custom Breathing Audio Files

This directory contains the breathing audio files used by the BreatheFlow application.

## File Requirements

- **Format**: WAV files only
- **Naming**: Must be exactly `inhale.wav` and `exhale.wav`
- **Quality**: High-quality audio recommended for best experience

## Current Files

- `inhale.wav` - Sound played during inhale phases
- `exhale.wav` - Sound played during exhale phases

## How to Replace

1. **Backup** your current audio files if needed
2. **Replace** the existing files with your custom breathing audio
3. **Ensure** the files are named exactly `inhale.wav` and `exhale.wav`
4. **Restart** the application if it's running

## Audio Settings

In the application, you can:
- Toggle between synthetic tones and custom audio files
- Adjust volume levels
- The settings are located in the sidebar of the main page

## Troubleshooting

- If custom audio doesn't play, check the browser console for errors
- Ensure the files are valid WAV format
- The application will fallback to synthetic sounds if custom audio fails to load
